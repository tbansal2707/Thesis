# Thesis

Thesis 1 :
- Computed energy parameters for components of furnace (pipes, combustion chamber, bends etc.) to design a MATLAB code configurable for different part arrangements, material properties, dimensions and ambient conditions creating energy, mass and temperature profiles over time and space
- Verified the code with experimental results; Expanded usage to increase efficiency of furnaces in rural India

Thesis 2 :
- Built a System Dynamics model charting the informal waste system in Delhi & created separate models to analyse the impact of government policies on informal system; Proposed policy changes to current scenarios
- Estimated 50+ parameters; Validated model using sensitivity analysis and 7 behavioral tests
- Conducted comparative case study between Delhi and Bali models of informal sector using System Dynamics
